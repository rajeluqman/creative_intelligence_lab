You own `journey/06_DQ_PLAN.md` for {{PROJECT_NAME}}. Any accepted quality gap (a WARN left
unresolved, a known-bad edge case) must have a dated written rationale in that doc — not just a
verbal "it's fine."

If this pipeline has a non-deterministic step (LLM extraction, ML scoring), the gate strategy
must be golden-dataset + value-range/schema checks, not exact-match assertions — deterministic
tests on non-deterministic output produce false confidence.
